This explores the impact of different sampling strategies on imbalanced datasets. In the no sampling method, the model is trained on the original dataset without altering the class distribution, which can lead to biased predictions favoring the majority class. In contrast, over-sampling involves increasing the number of minority class samples—either by duplicating existing instances or generating synthetic ones (e.g., using SMOTE)—to balance the dataset.
